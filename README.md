Task 5 from the Itransition Internship:
Implement a Web-application for the fake (random) user data generation.

The single app page allows to:
1) select region (at least 3 different, e.g. Poland, USA, Georgia or anything you prefer)
2) specify the number of error per record (slider 0..10 + binded number field with max value limit at least 1000)
3) define seed value and [Random] button to generate a random seed
